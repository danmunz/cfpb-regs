CFPB Regs
=========

Based on the [awesome federalregister.gov API](https://www.federalregister.gov/blog/learn/developers), this is a quick prototype to demonstrate a few things:

* You can use the API to power an up-to-date "here are some opportunities to comment on our regulations" page
* You can kiiiinda link that with regs.gov URLs to get right to the commenting part ([thanks, @soundofmachines!](https://twitter.com/soundofmachines/status/148179236543397888))
* You can easily filter across types of federal register notices: rule, proposed rule, notice, all
* You can build it to be responsive

More broadly, this was my first attempt at actually getting hands-on with a JSON API, using jQuery.getJSON(), etc. I'm sure the code or functionality can be improved. If you feel so inclined, open an issue, or even better, send me a pull request!
